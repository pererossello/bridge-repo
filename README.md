# BRIDGE

This repository will contain the implementation of **BRIDGE** (Bayesian Reconstruction and Inference of Data-driven Generative Environments), a GPU-accelerated, differentiable framework written in [`jax`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/index.html) for field-level inference in large-scale structure cosmology.

The BRIDGE code leverages efficient structure formation techniques (ALPT; [Kitaura & Heß 2013](https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/435/1/L78/1097681)) and incorporates the HICOBIAN bias model ([Coloma-Nadal et al. 2024](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2024/07/083)) for physically motivated nonlocal bias based on a differentiable cosmic-web classification, all within a fully Bayesian framework

For more details, refer to our paper:
**Rosselló, P. et al.** (2025). [_Differentiable Fuzzy Cosmic-Web for Field-Level Inference_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03969)

The code will be made publicly available soon.
